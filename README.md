Project Title: Student Score Prediction with Linear Regression

Description:

This project focuses on predicting a student's score based on the number of hours they study using a supervised machine learning approach, specifically linear regression. The dataset used contains information on the number of hours a student studies and their corresponding scores. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

Key Steps and Components:

Data Loading and Exploration:

The project begins with loading the dataset, visualizing it with a scatter plot, and exploring the relationship between study hours and scores.
Linear Regression Model:

A simple linear regression model is trained on the entire dataset to establish a relationship between study hours and scores.
Prediction and Visualization:

The trained model is used to predict the score for a hypothetical scenario of a student studying 9.25 hours. The regression line is visualized on the scatter plot.
Train-Test Split:

To assess the model's performance on unseen data, the dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Model Evaluation:

A new linear regression model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the testing set. The model's accuracy is assessed using the R-squared score.
Final Prediction:

The final step involves predicting the score for 9.25 hours of study using the newly trained model.
Tools and Libraries:

Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Conclusion:
This project showcases the application of a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on study hours. The inclusion of a train-test split ensures a robust evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.
